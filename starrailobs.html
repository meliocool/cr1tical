            <h2>About this game</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Honkai Star Rail is a turn-based RPG that focuses on the story of the Honkai, a race of mechanical beings who 
            are slowly taking over Earth. The game provides players with a large cast of characters, each with their own 
            unique playstyle and backstory. Players can customize their characters by equipping them with new weapons and 
            accessories, which can then be upgraded to provide additional benefits in battle. Players can also complete 
            puzzles and minigames in between battles, keeping gameplay from becoming monotonous or repetitive. 
            Honkai Star Rail provides a level of depth and strategy to its gameplay that makes battles feel 
            rewarding and challenging, without being overwhelming for novice players. The inclusion of puzzles 
            and minigames
         adds variety to the gameplay without distracting from its focus on storytelling, which is essential for any visual novel.</p>
