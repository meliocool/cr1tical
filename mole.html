            <h2>About this game</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, commonly known as ML or MLBB, is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game 
            developed and published by Moonton, a ByteDance subsidiary. Since its release in 2016, the game has grown ADVANCE SERVER
            in popularity worldwide, most notably in Southeast Asia, and has since surpassed the 1 billion downloads milestone, 
            with peak monthly players of 100 million. In 2021, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang achieved an all-time gross of US$1 billion, with 44 percent of its revenue coming from outside Asia, making it the top mobile game of its genre with the most global appeal.
            The game sets two teams of five against each other in real-time, with at least 10-second matchmaking and 10-minute matches. Players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and protect their own in a traditional battle arena game. Unlike traditional MOBAs, there is no hero leveling or pay to play aspect—winners and losers are determined by skill, ability, and strategy.</p>
